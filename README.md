# WAD Basics of HTML to Basics of CSS

This repository contains source files that cover key concepts of HTML and CSS, focusing on building and styling web pages. It is designed for beginners or anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of web development basics.

## 📝 Description

In this repository, you will find solutions to problems and exercises that help reinforce your knowledge of HTML and CSS. Starting with basic structure and styles, the source files provide practical examples and code snippets for each concept.

## 💻 How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zainkashif1122/Complete-HTML-and-CSS-Course.git
2. Open the files in your preferred code editor (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
3. Explore the HTML structure and corresponding CSS styles. Modify the code to gain hands-on experience with layouts, colors, and other design elements.

> **Note:** Each `index` file is connected to its corresponding `style` file. For example, `index1.html` is linked with `style1.1.css`, and this pattern follows for all other `index` files. The number of the `index` file matches the number of its associated CSS file and other attachments. If you want to access the entire folder, you can download the [zip file](HTML&CSS) from the repository.
